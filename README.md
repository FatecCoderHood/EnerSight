<h1 id="pushpin-hiathos-project">📌 EnerSight</h1>
EnerSight is an analytical web platform developed for <a href="https://www.tecsysbrasil.com.br/">TECSYS</a> to centralize, organize, and process public ANEEL data.

## **Project Challenge**
<p align="justify">
Electric power distribution companies operate in a highly regulated environment where service quality indicators directly affect regulatory compliance, operational efficiency, and financial performance. However, critical information about network reliability, service interruptions, and technical losses is often dispersed across multiple public ANEEL sources, making analysis fragmented, slow, and difficult to standardize. As a result, technical and commercial teams struggle to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>obtain a clear comparative view of network performance across utilities, regions, and electrical groupings;</li>
<li>identify areas with higher operational risk;</li>
<li>prioritize infrastructure investments and corrective actions;</li>
<li>monitor long-term trends in DEC and FEC indicators efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Without a centralized analytical solution, these evaluations depend on manual effort, disconnected datasets, and limited visibility, reducing decision-making quality and making regulatory analysis more time-consuming. The platform automates the collection of public datasets, stores them in a structured database, and enables users to analyze network continuity indicators such as DEC and FEC across different utilities, regions, and electrical groupings.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Through this approach, EnerSight helps technical and commercial teams:
<ul>
<li>access consolidated regulatory data in a single environment;</li>
<li>compare operational performance across different network segments;</li>
<li>identify regions approaching or exceeding regulatory limits;</li>
<li>support decision-making for monitoring, prioritization, and future analytical expansion.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Its main features include:
<ul>
<li>Automated collection of regulatory data from ANEEL;</li>
<li>Analysis of continuity indicators such as DEC and FEC;</li>
<li>visualization of comparative analytical data; </li>
<li>User management with access control;</li>
<li>system logging for technical monitoring and traceability. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">
EnerSight was designed with an architecture that supports future evolution, including analytical intelligence modules and predictive capabilities for electrical network behavior.

<h1 id="white_check_mark-requirements">✅ Requirements</h1>

<details>
  <summary><b>Functional Requirements</b></summary>

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RF01 | User Registration, Authentication and Access Control | The system must allow new users to self-register with full name, email, password, and optional phone number. Every new user must be created with `PENDING` status. Only users with `ACTIVE` status may access the platform. The system must also support secure authentication, mandatory password change on the first login of the initial administrator, and a controlled email-change flow with identity validation. |
| RF02 | Administrative User Management | The system must allow administrators to view, search, filter, and manage registered users, including approval, rejection with mandatory justification, profile updates when necessary, anonymization of personal data, and granting or removing administrative privileges. |
| RF03 | Terms, Acknowledgements and Consent Management | The system must display the Terms of Use, Privacy Notice, and optional marketing consent during user registration, recording acceptance, acknowledgement, and optional consent separately. The system must keep version history of terms, maintain historical records, and allow optional consent revocation without affecting access to core platform features. |
| RF04 | Data Subject Rights and Privacy Requests | The system must support handling data subject requests related to access, correction, anonymization, or deletion when applicable, and must keep a minimal record of such requests as well as a basic inventory of personal data processing operations related to the user module. |
| RF05 | System Logging and Log Access | The system must record authentication logs, user-management logs, and relevant application execution events, including critical administrative operations. These records must contain the minimum information required for auditability and traceability, with access restricted to authorized administrators and logical separation from the main application database. |
| RF06 | Automatic and Manual ANEEL Data Collection | The system must perform periodic automatic collection of public ANEEL data and also allow manual execution by authorized administrators in order to obtain regulatory data for future analysis, indicators, and rankings. |
| RF07 | Validation, Processing and Storage of Collected Data | The system must validate the structure and format of collected files, process and normalize accepted data, reject or flag data incompatible with the expected model, store processed records with source and batch traceability, and prevent improper duplication during reprocessing or recurring imports. |
| RF08 | Historical Preservation and Data Consistency | The system must preserve the history of valid data, term versions, acceptance records, and relevant events, ensuring consistency between the active database, logs, anonymization records, and backup restoration processes. |
| RF09 | Analytical Visualization and Operational Ranking | The system must allow users to view a ranked analytical table based on previously collected and stored data from ANEEL public datasets, initially displaying DEC, DEC limit, FEC, and FEC limit indicators. It must support filtering by year, distributor, state, electrical group, and substation, as well as sorting by indicators and identifying regions near or above regulatory limits. The system must also support visual or logical classification of operational units based on the comparison between measured indicators and regulatory thresholds, and preserve structural compatibility for future inclusion of complementary indicators such as technical and non-technical losses without compromising the main continuity-focused visualization. |
| RF10 | Geographical Visualization of Operational Indicators | The system must allow geographical visualization of electrical network operational indicators based on previously collected and stored data from ANEEL public datasets and the available geographic base, initially presenting DEC and FEC indicators in heatmap format. It must support filtering by year, month when available, distributor, state, electrical group, and substation, as well as selection of the indicator shown on the map. The system must preserve structural compatibility for future inclusion of technical and non-technical losses in the geographic view, as well as future evolution toward network-segment and electrical-circuit granularity. |

  <summary><b>Non-Functional Requirements</b></summary>

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RNF01 | Security and Credential Protection | The system must store passwords only using secure cryptographic hashing. The initial administrator credential must not be stored in source code, versioned scripts, or public documentation, and must be provisioned through a secure mechanism. |
| RNF02 | Access Control and Confidentiality | The system must restrict access to features, user data, and logs according to user role and need-to-know rules, ensuring that only authorized administrators can perform sensitive operations or access restricted records. |
| RNF03 | LGPD Compliance and Data Minimization | The system must comply with the principles of purpose limitation, necessity, adequacy, security, transparency, and accountability, collecting and processing only the data strictly necessary for platform operation. |
| RNF04 | Integrity and Traceability | The system must ensure traceability of critical actions and integrity of user records, terms, consents, anonymization actions, data collection executions, and logs, without improper overwriting of historical records. |
| RNF05 | Data Protection in Logs | The system must not record passwords, tokens, secrets, session cookies, or full payloads containing unnecessary personal data in logs, and should use pseudonymization or masking whenever possible. |
| RNF06 | Data Retention and Disposal | The system must adopt a retention policy compatible with the purpose of each type of data, including an approximate retention period of 6 months for logs, 90 days for backups, and controlled retention of acceptance and consent records according to the project policy. |
| RNF07 | Backup and Anonymization Consistency | Backup restoration must not automatically reactivate data that has already been anonymized or deleted from the active database. The system must provide a technical mechanism to reapply anonymization when necessary. |
| RNF08 | Operational Simplicity and Maintainability | The solution must prioritize implementation simplicity, low operational cost, ease of maintenance, and logical separation between operational data, logs, and collected regulatory data. |
| RNF09 | Basic Availability and Scalability | The system must support the expected initial volume of users, logs, and periodic data collection jobs, while allowing future growth without compromising essential MVP functionality. |
| RNF10 | Minimum Usability | The interfaces for registration, user management, log consultation, and administrative operations must be clear, objective, and appropriate for the expected use within the initial project scope. |
| RNF11 | Minimum Performance for Analytical Queries | The analytical visualization functionality must respond adequately to the initial project data volume, supporting filtering and sorting without compromising the basic MVP user experience. |
| RNF12 | Clarity of Ordering and Interpretation | The ranking interface must clearly indicate the applied sorting criteria and present indicators in a way that is understandable to users, avoiding ambiguity in analytical interpretation. |
| RNF13 | Separation Between Analytical Data and Personal Data | The ranking functionality must operate exclusively on public and aggregated ANEEL data within the current scope, without displaying or depending on platform users' personal data. |
| RNF14 | Minimum Performance for Geographical Visualization | The heatmap functionality must respond adequately to the initial data volume and filter set expected for the MVP. |

<h1 id="rocket-running-the-project">🚀 Running the Project</h1>

EnerSight is split into five independently-run projects. Each has its own README with what it
does, how to run it, and how to run its tests — start there for details.

| Project | What it is | Run it via |
|---|---|---|
| [`frontend/`](frontend/README.md) | Vue 3 + TypeScript SPA | `npm run dev` |
| [`backend/enersight-api/`](backend/enersight-api/README.md) | Geo/data REST API (OAuth2 resource server) | `./mvnw spring-boot:run` |
| [`backend/enersight-auth/`](backend/enersight-auth/README.md) | Identity provider — login, JWT issuance, user management | `docker compose up enersight-auth` |
| [`backend/enersight-worker/`](backend/enersight-worker/README.md) | ANEEL data ingestion (Python) | `docker compose up enersight-worker` |
| [`backend/enersight-temporal-series/`](backend/enersight-temporal-series/README.md) | Prophet forecasting pipeline + read API | `docker compose up enersight-temporal-series-api` |

All backend services that have a Docker image are wired into one compose file:

```bash
cd backend/docker
docker compose up -d
```

`enersight-api` and the frontend don't have Docker images yet — run them directly (`./mvnw
spring-boot:run` and `npm run dev` respectively) against the dockerized databases. See each
project's README for environment variables, manual verification steps, and how to run that
project's tests.

<br>

<h1 id="gear-branching-and-commit-standard-strategies">🌿 Branching and Commit Standard Strategies</h1>

<details>
  <summary><b>Branching</b></summary>

<img width="1900" height="1010" alt="Confluence-doc-branch-flow" src="image/branchFlow.PNG" />

#### **Logic**

`feature/*` → Development of new features  
`develop` → Continuous integration of features (staging / testing environment)  
`release` → Delivery version for production. Always stable  
`hotfix/*` → Urgent fixes applied directly to the release

---

#### **Feature Branch Naming**

Start with the **Task ID in uppercase**, followed by a slash (`/`).
The description must use **lowercase words separated by hyphens (`-`)**, with no spaces.

**Example:** `ES-01/login-screen`

---

#### **Workflow**

##### **Creating Feature Branches**

Update your local `develop` branch:

```bash
git fetch --all
git checkout develop
git pull
```

From the `develop` branch, create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b ES-XX/feature-name
```

Develop the functionality and update the feature branch using `git add`, `commit`, and `push`.

To keep your feature branch up to date with `develop`:

```bash
git fetch --all
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout ES-XX/feature-name
git merge develop
```

Resolve conflicts if necessary.

Open a **Pull Request (PR)** targeting the `develop` branch.

Follow the review process and **keep updating your feature branch with `develop` changes**.

After **two approvals**, merge the code into `develop`.

---

#### **Releases**

Releases happen at the **end of each sprint**.

#### ⚠️ **Important:**

If something is not stable, it must **not be included in the release**.
In this case, either:

* Perform a **partial release** (only what is ready), or
* **Delay the release**.

---

#### **Hotfixes**

Hotfix branches are created **from the `release` branch (not from `develop`)**.

After applying the fix, the changes must be merged:

* Into the **`release` branch** (immediate correction in production)
* Into the **`develop` branch** (to keep branches synchronized)

</details>
  
<details>
  <summary><strong>Commit Standard</strong></summary>

### **Commit Writing Standard**

Start with the Task ID in uppercase, followed by a space, then the commit type, a colon, and a short description of what was done in lowercase.
